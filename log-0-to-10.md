# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Make a simple JS code for changing background color with fade effect

**Thoughts:** I'm not completely satisfied of my code elegance and I would like to make fade with JavaScript and not with CSS. But overall I'm really happy to start this journey of code!

### Day 2: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Start a to do list app, some issue with mouse events
**Thoughts:** I understand the importance to project UI before coding. I feel unsatisfied about my work because a lot of time spent and few lines of code as result.

### Day 3: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Start weather app for a FreeCodeCamp project. Get json data: done.
**Thoughts:** I'm happy to get all json data from an api. More happy when I'm rewriting the same app in pure JS.

### Day 4: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Start a repository for test my Ajax studies.

### Day 5: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continue working on Ajax. Studying the difference between Javascript and jQuery
**Thoughts:** It's seems like jQuery, with its less code, hides all the parts of which a thing needs to work.
