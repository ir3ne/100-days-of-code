# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Make a simple JS code for changing background color with fade effect

**Thoughts:** I'm not completely satisfied of my code elegance and I would like to make fade with JavaScript and not with CSS. But overall I'm really happy to start this journey of code!

### Day 1: December 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Study and exercizes with createElement, appendChild and mostly event object

**Thoughts:** After study and practice I have been started a to do list app. Just started. Tomorrow I'm going to finish it. I'm satisfied about things learned today.

### Day 2: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Start a to do list app, some issue with mouse events
**Thoughts:** I understand the importance to project UI before coding. I feel unsatisfied about my work because a lot of time spent and few lines of code as result.
